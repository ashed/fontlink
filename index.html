    <p>FontLink is a small program for Unix-like systems that allows you to use fonts without having to install them.</p>

    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

    <p>FontLink has a simple interface that mainly consists of two lists. The left one contains font sets; the right one shows fonts of the selected set. Each has a context menu and a toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used actions.</p>
    <p>You can create new sets or just use the default one. To quickly rename a set, click twice on it. To change its position in the list, drag it with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key pressed.</p>
    <p>In addition to using the context menu or the toolbar button, you can add fonts by dropping them from your file manager anywhere on the FontLink's window.</p>
    <p>The same font can be in multiple sets. In this case, disabling or removing such a font from one set does not unlink it if it is still enabled in others.</p>
    <p>If you add a font that is already installed somewhere on your system, it will appear as “inactive” and its checkbox will always be enabled. Check its pop-up tooltip to see where it is installed.</p>
    <p>FontLink has an icon in the notification area, which you can click with the middle mouse button to quickly hide/show the main window. If you want to add FontLink to autostart, don't forget to add <code>--minimized</code> or <code>-m</code> argument to start the program with the hidden window.</p>
    <p>It is recommended to set up your fonts <em>before</em> running a program that will use them, because not all programs can update a list of fonts at runtime. For example, GIMP and LibreOffice can do this, but Inkscape and Scribus cannot.</p>
    <p>Remember that fonts added to FontLink are linked only while it is running.</p>
