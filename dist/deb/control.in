Description: Small utility to install fonts temporarily
 FontLink is a small GTK+ utility to install fonts temporarily on Unix-like
 systems.
 .
 It allows you to quickly install certain fonts only when you really
 need them without copying fonts or creating symlinks to special
 directories by hand.
 .
 FontLink has a very simple interface with which you can group fonts into
 sets (for example, one set per project) and quickly enable or disable
 certain fonts as well as entire sets in a single click.
